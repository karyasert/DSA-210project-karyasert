# Yoga & Pilates Study Performance Analysis

## **Project Overview**
Over the next few weeks, I will analyze how **yoga and pilates impact my study productivity and academic performance**. By tracking **exercise type, duration, intensity, and timing**, I aim to determine whether specific workout patterns improve **focus, study efficiency, and academic success**.

Using data visualization and statistical tools, I will explore patterns and test whether incorporating structured workout routines leads to **better academic outcomes**. Ultimately, I hope this project provides actionable insights for optimizing study habits through exercise.

## **Objectives**
1. **Understand Exercise-Study Connection**  
   Explore how different types of workouts affect study habits and academic performance.

2. **Identify Key Performance Factors**  
   Pinpoint which exercise variables (intensity, duration, timing) have the strongest impact on focus and study efficiency.

3. **Data-Driven Study Optimization**  
   Use insights from the analysis to fine-tune my daily habits and improve academic performance.

4. **Apply Data Science Skills**  
   Implement data collection, visualization, and machine learning techniques to uncover meaningful trends.

## **Motivation**
This project combines two essential aspects of my life: **yoga,pilates and academics**.Over the years I skipped exercising in order to buy some time to study and focus.I am aiming to prove this wrong by doing yoga and pilates regularly. Here’s why it matters:

- **Personal Growth**  
  Understanding how my physical activity affects study efficiency can help me build better long-term habits without hesitation.
  
- **Scientific Approach**  
  This project allows me to apply a structured approach to study performance optimization which can be a proof of the impacts of yoga and pilates.
  
- **Practical Application**  
  This is a chance to apply **data science techniques** to a real-world personal problem, making the learning process more hands-on.Moreover ,I will make sure I will workout at least once a day in order to collect data constantly .
  
- **Long-Term Impact**  
  Most of the time we skip exercising in order to win some time to study.However, I want to analyse if winning some time actually means anything over skipping to exercise.

## **Dataset**
The dataset for this project consists of several weeks of daily records. Here’s what I’ll be tracking:

- **Date**: The specific day of the record  
- **Exercise Type**: Yoga or Pilates  
- **Duration**: Total time spent per session (minutes)  
- **Intensity**: Low, Medium, or High  
- **Time of Day**: When the exercise occurred (Morning, Afternoon, Evening)  
- **Study Hours**: Total time spent studying that day  
- **Focus Level (1-10)**: Self-rated concentration level  
- **Academic Performance (1-10)**: Grades from assignments, tests, or self-assessed progress  

I will log all of this data consistently, ensuring accurate and structured tracking. Outliers due to illness, distractions, or major schedule changes will be flagged for review.

## **Example Analysis**
To illustrate, I’ll create a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between **exercise intensity and focus levels**. The x-axis will represent exercise intensity (Low, Medium, High), while the y-axis will show self-rated focus levels (1-10). If a clear upward trend appears, it might suggest that more intense workouts help sustain better concentration.

Another example involves comparing performance on **exercise days vs. non-exercise days**. This could reveal whether working out before studying leads to increased focus and productivity.

Similarly, I’ll look at **time-of-day trends**—does exercising in the morning vs. evening impact study effectiveness differently?

## **Conclusion**
By the end of this project, I hope to answer the following questions:

- Does **yoga or pilates improve study efficiency and academic performance?**  
- What is the **optimal workout timing** for the best learning outcomes?  
- Can I **predict academic performance based on exercise habits?**  
- How do **focus levels change with different workout intensities?**  

This project isn’t just about improving my study routine—it’s about leveraging data science to develop an **evidence-based approach to learning and yoga**.
