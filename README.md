# Yoga & Pilates Study Performance Analysis

## **Project Overview**
Over the next few weeks, I will analyze how **yoga and pilates impact my study productivity and academic performance**. By tracking **exercise type, duration, intensity, and timing**, I aim to determine whether specific workout patterns improve **focus, study efficiency, and academic success**.

Using data visualization and statistical tools, I will explore patterns and test whether incorporating structured workout routines leads to **better academic outcomes**. Ultimately, I hope this project provides actionable insights for optimizing study habits through exercise.

## **Objectives**
1. **Understand Exercise-Study Connection**  
   Explore how different types of workouts affect study habits and academic performance.

2. **Identify Key Performance Factors**  
   Pinpoint which exercise variables (intensity, duration, timing) have the strongest impact on focus and study efficiency.

3. **Data-Driven Study Optimization**  
   Use insights from the analysis to fine-tune my daily habits and improve academic performance.

4. **Apply Data Science Skills**  
   Implement data collection, visualization, and machine learning techniques to uncover meaningful trends.

## **Motivation**
This project combines two essential aspects of my life: **fitness and academics**. Here’s why it matters:

- **Personal Growth**  
  Understanding how my physical activity affects study efficiency can help me build better long-term habits.
  
- **Scientific Approach**  
  I want to base my learning strategies on **data, not assumptions**. This project allows me to apply a structured approach to study performance optimization.
  
- **Practical Application**  
  This is a chance to apply **data science techniques** to a real-world personal problem, making the learning process more hands-on.
  
- **Long-Term Impact**  
  The findings won’t just improve my current academic performance—they could help shape better productivity strategies beyond school.

## **Dataset**
The dataset for this project consists of several weeks of daily records. Here’s what I’ll be tracking:

- **Date**: The specific day of the record  
- **Exercise Type**: Yoga or Pilates  
- **Duration**: Total time spent per session (minutes)  
- **Intensity**: Low, Medium, or High  
- **Time of Day**: When the exercise occurred (Morning, Afternoon, Evening)  
- **Study Hours**: Total time spent studying that day  
- **Focus Level (1-10)**: Self-rated concentration level  
- **Academic Performance (%)**: Grades from assignments, tests, or self-assessed progress  

I will log all of this data consistently, ensuring accurate and structured tracking. Outliers due to illness, distractions, or major schedule changes will be flagged for review.

## **Tools and Technologies**
I will use the following tools for data analysis and visualization:

- **Python**: For data cleaning and statistical analysis  
- **Pandas**: To manipulate and preprocess data  
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn**: For creating visualizations (scatter plots, heatmaps, time series)  
- **SciPy**: For hypothesis testing and regression analysis  

---

## **Analysis Plan**

### **1. Data Collection**  
   - Import daily records into a Pandas DataFrame and preprocess the data by handling missing values and standardizing numerical features.  

### **2. Visualization**  
   - Use scatter plots, heatmaps, and time series plots to explore relationships between variables.  
   - Example analyses:
     - Scatter plot of study hours vs. academic performance  
     - Heatmap showing correlations between exercise, study time, and grades  
     - Time series analysis of performance trends over multiple weeks  

### **3. Hypothesis Testing**  
   - Test hypotheses such as:  
     - **H₀**: Exercise has no significant effect on study productivity and academic performance.  
     - **H₁**: Yoga or pilates significantly improve study efficiency and academic performance.  
   - Use regression models to analyze the strongest predictors of improvement.

### **4. Trend Analysis**  
   - Investigate patterns in study performance over time, identifying peaks or declines in efficiency.
   - Assess how study habits change on workout vs. non-workout days.

## **Example Analysis**
To illustrate, I’ll create a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between **exercise intensity and focus levels**. The x-axis will represent exercise intensity (Low, Medium, High), while the y-axis will show self-rated focus levels (1-10). If a clear upward trend appears, it might suggest that more intense workouts help sustain better concentration.

Another example involves comparing performance on **exercise days vs. non-exercise days**. This could reveal whether working out before studying leads to increased focus and productivity.

Similarly, I’ll look at **time-of-day trends**—does exercising in the morning vs. evening impact study effectiveness differently? 

---

## **Conclusion**
By the end of this project, I hope to answer the following questions:

- Does **yoga or pilates improve study efficiency and academic performance?**  
- What is the **optimal workout timing** for the best learning outcomes?  
- Can I **predict academic performance based on exercise habits?**  
- How do **focus levels change with different workout intensities?**  

This project isn’t just about improving my study routine—it’s about leveraging data science to develop an **evidence-based approach to learning and fitness**.
