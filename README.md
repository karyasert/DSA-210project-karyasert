# Yoga & Pilates Study Performance Analysis

## **Project Idea**
In this project, I will analyze how **yoga and pilates impact my study productivity and academic performance**. By tracking **exercise type, duration, intensity, and timing**, I will determine whether specific workout patterns improve **focus, study efficiency, and academic success**. 

I aim to understand how **regular exercise influences learning outcomes** and whether adjusting my fitness routine can lead to better academic performance.

## **Description of Dataset**
I will collect daily data for several weeks, logging:

- **Exercise Type:** Yoga or Pilates
- **Exercise Duration:** Minutes spent per session
- **Exercise Intensity:** Low, Medium, High
- **Time of Day:** Morning, Afternoon, or Evening session
- **Study Hours:** Total hours studied that day
- **Focus Level (1-10):** Self-reported concentration rating
- **Academic Performance (1-10):** Self-measurments of exam scores, assignment results, or GPA over time

|

### **Additional Factors to Track**
- **Study session timing:** Morning, afternoon, or evening
- **Focus levels before & after workouts:** To measure immediate cognitive benefits
- **Academic performance trends:** Long-term tracking of GPA or test scores

## **Plan**
### **üìå Data Collection**
Data will be collected daily while ensuring:
- **Consistent study environment** to reduce external influences.
- **Standardized self-reporting** of focus and study productivity.
- **Accurate exercise tracking** for intensity and duration.

### **üìä Data Preparation & Analysis**
At the end of the study period:
1. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Convert text-based categories into numerical labels.
   - Remove inconsistencies in self-reported data.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Identify trends using visualization techniques (scatter plots, heatmaps, line charts).
   - Compare **exercise vs. non-exercise days**.
3. **Statistical & Correlation Analysis:**
   - Assess **relationship between exercise and study performance**.
   - Test for statistical significance using regression models.
4. **Predictive Modeling:**
   - Train a **regression model** to predict **study performance based on workout habits**.
   - Use clustering techniques to find **optimal exercise patterns** for learning efficiency.

## **Hypothesis**
- **Null Hypothesis (H‚ÇÄ):** Yoga and pilates have no significant effect on study productivity and academic performance.
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H‚ÇÅ):** Yoga and pilates significantly improve study efficiency and academic performance.

---

## **Tools & Technologies**
- **Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)** for data processing & visualization.
- **Scikit-learn** for machine learning models.
- **NLTK/SpaCy** for sentiment analysis (if analyzing study notes).
- **Jupyter Notebook** for data analysis & documentation.

---

## **Findings & Expected Insights**
By analyzing this dataset, I expect to:
- Identify whether **yoga and pilates improve study efficiency**.
- Determine the **best time of day for exercise to maximize learning**.
- Predict **how workouts impact academic performance over time**.
- Suggest an **optimal fitness routine for better focus & grades**.

## **Conclusion**
This project aims to answer:
- **Does yoga or pilates improve my study efficiency and academic performance?**
- **Is there an optimal time of day to work out for maximum learning benefits?**
- **How do focus levels change with different workout intensities?**
- **Can a data-driven approach help optimize study habits?**

By leveraging data science, this project will provide **insights into the role of exercise in academic success**, helping me (and potentially others) improve study habits using fitness strategies.
